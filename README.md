This is a simple link list that can be used as a chrome extension. Written by [Michaela Lehr](http://twitter.com/FischaelaMeer).

Download and use
----------------
The zip file contains the whole yeoman project. To distribute run "grunt" in the master directory. Since I don't know yet, if I will publish the extension, to use it, visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and import the unpacked files in the dist folder. Once you open a new tab the link list will be your blank page.
